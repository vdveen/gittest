Lab Assignment 2 - Andrew van der Veen, 10166883

1. Defining the Problem
The problem is to create a function to easily convert DMS values in comma-separated-values files (.csv) to DD and to output them in a file.

2. Design a solution
Flowchart:
See attatchment.

Pseudocode:
Open csv file
Take line from file
Separate longitude from latitude

Take longitude
Create a function to convert both to DMS to DD:
	Convert first and second number to float
	Take first and second number and divide by 60
	If there is a third number, divide it also by 60
	Add all the inputted numbers together
	Return DD value
Do the same for latitude

Create new output file
Create header line
Store the long and lat in a new output file, on the same line.




3. Write the code
def dms_to_dd(d, m, s=0)
